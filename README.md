# ScalableC3
Competency ledger on a public blockchain network of universities and open source orgs for awarding badges and certificates to students can remain decentralized in the public blockchain network of schools and will always be one source of truth for authenticity.

# Inspiration
The government school curriculum in India has been designed in a standardised manner for each grade. In a typical classroom, however, students are always at varying levels of comprehension and grasping power. There is therefore a need to personalise learning for students so that they can learn at a level suitable to them. There are more than 264 million students in government schools in India who need access to such personalised learning.

Learning passbook is currently being conceptualised as a comprehensive student engagement and learning record available to teachers, parents and students at all times.
