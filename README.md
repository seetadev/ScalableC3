# ScalableC3

Competency ledger on a public blockchain network of universities and open source orgs for awarding badges and certificates to students can remain decentralized in the public blockchain network of schools and will always be one source of truth for authenticity.

# Inspiration
The government school curriculum in India has been designed in a standardised manner for each grade. In a typical classroom, however, students are always at varying levels of comprehension and grasping power. There is therefore a need to personalise learning for students so that they can learn at a level suitable to them. There are more than 264 million students in government schools in India who need access to such personalised learning.

Learning passbook is currently being conceptualised as a comprehensive student engagement and learning record available to teachers, parents and students at all times.

Usage of Web3 Technology

1. Moralis Transaction Dashboard: We are developing an aggregated dashboard for all transfers and transactions using Moralis boilerplate as a reference. Please visit the link at https://github.com/seetadev/ScalableC3/tree/main/ethereum-tx-dashboard

Deployment URL: https://1li2klwerizr.usemoralis.com:2053/server (to be deployed to moralis)


2. XMTP: We are implementing XMTP Chat for Project administrators in a particular region. Please visit the implementation link: https://github.com/seetadev/ScalableC3/tree/main/competency_passbook/XMTPChat

3. Filecoin Network: Vital project Metadata on Filecoin Network. We are storing vital project monitoring data on Filecoin network. Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/ScalableC3/tree/main/store-data-filecoin-network

4. Valist: We are using Valist to distribute 2 apps:

a. Project Meeting Notes built using React and Tableland
b. Competency Passbook: https://github.com/seetadev/ScalableC3/tree/main/competency_passbook/Valist-distribute

5. Fluence: We are utilizing and developing on Rhai. Rhai is an embedded scripting language for Rust (https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai). Rhai Functions for Fluence allows you to execute Rhai functions and statements. The function can be defined in one call and it's results can be fetched from another call.

6. Chainlink: https://github.com/seetadev/ScalableC3/tree/main/chainlink-access-offchain-data
We are learning to utilize how smart contracts on NEAR can access off-chain data using Chainlink Oracles.

7. Tableland: Project Meeting Notes powered by Tableland at https://github.com/seetadev/ScalableC3/tree/main/competency_passbook/Project-Notes-tableland
